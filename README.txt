Features This app will enable you to update Rosters for the following Systems/Madden Football Games:

Sega Genesis/Megadrive 
John Madden Football ('91)

This also works with the Madden â€˜93 ROM for Genesis that was updated to include the Jaguars and Panthers. Please contact me for further details in obtaining this ROM.

The Editor will automatically remove the checksum for all games listed above so you should have no issue running the game after you modify the ROM.

How to Use Extract Application from Zip file and Double-click on it, choose any Madden game listed above and the Editor will open, showing all of the player data for each team. Choose a team you want to edit by selecting it in the dropdown on the upper left. Editor converts ratings from 0-99 to 0-15 so the game can read it. After you're done changing the player data, make sure to click SAVE, the editor is designed to update ONE TEAM AT A TIME. If you edit one team and go on to another without saving, your changes will be lost.

If you want to use the 'Import from Excel' feature you need to make sure of the following:

I based my editor off the ratings from https://maddenratings.weebly.com/madden-nfl-23.html You can download all of the rosters for each team here. As of 12/22, these spreadsheets are working with my editor because the column headers match up. You must make sure that the following column headers are included in whatever spreadsheet you import from. You can have additional column headers, I just ignore them. You must use the individual rosters, please don't mix teams into 1 spreadsheet and try to use it that way. So 1 team in the editor, one spreadsheet with JUST that teams player data.

Agility
Awareness
Break Tackle
Carrying
Catching
Jersey Number
Kick Power
Kick Accuracy
Man Coverage
Overall Rating
Pass Block
Position
Pursuit
Run Block
Speed
Tackle
Throw Accuracy Middle
Throw On The Run
Throw Power
Weight

Again, the column headers in your spreadsheet MUST MATCH EXACTLY with what's above.

Also, for positions (which as of 12/22 are exactly what I'm looking for in my editor) YOU MUST MAKE SURE THEY MATCH EXACTLY below (PR/KR are not included in the spreadsheets so you can either update them manually within the editor or add them to your spreadsheet after you've downloaded them):

C/CB/DT/FB/FS/HB/K/KR/LE/LG/LOLB/LT/MLB/P/PR/QB/RE/RG/ROLB/RT/SS/TE/WR

Editor/Spreadsheet/Positon Name

KR - KR - Kick Returner
PR - PR - Punt Returner
LT - LT - Left Tackle
LG - LG - Left Guard

LDT - DT - Left Defensive Tackle

RDE - RE - Right Defensive End

RILB - MLB - Right Inside Linebacker
ROLB - ROLB - Right Outside Linebacker
LCB1 - CB - Left Cornerback 1
RCB1 - CB - Right Cornerback 1
LCB2 - CB - Left Cornerback 2
RCB2 - CB - Right Cornerback 2
SS - SS - Strong Saftey
FS - FS - Free Safety


All of these columns and positions are included in the spreadsheets from the link I mentioned above so it would be much easier to use those. One IMPORTANT note, within the editor, for example, you have QB1 and QB2. I thought about manually updating all the positions in the spreadsheet first but that would take forever so what I did was base the order off the OVERALL RATING in the spreadsheet. So the higher rated QB qould go into QB1, next rated QB2....and so on. One issue I found was when 2 players overall rating is the same, based on how the editor sorts it before it's imported, you could get either player as QB1. Example is Tua Tagovailoa and Teddy Bridgewater are both rated 75 so sometimes Editor makes Bridgewater QB1 which isn't correct. Easy fix is to fix it after the import then SAVE it or just edit it within the spreadsheet, just change Tua overall rating to 76 and you're done.

Please contact me with any bugs or anything else you would like to see in the Editor. Adding the Importing from Excel should speed up the process even more, hope this helps anyone out there who loves the older Madden games as much as I do.
